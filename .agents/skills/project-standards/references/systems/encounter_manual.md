# Encounter Systems Manual

## 1. Encounter Types

- **Wild**: Base probability according to the route.
- **Trainer**: Appear according to a "Pity" timer that increases by 5% every 2 minutes (max 20%).
- **Fishing**: Only on water routes, 10% base probability.
- **Defenders (Dominance Phase)**: 20% probability of finding a defender from the enemy faction on dominated maps during the weekend.

## 2. Guardians (Alpha Pokémon)

- **Spawn**: 1% probability on disputed maps.
- **Limit**: Only 1 guardian catch per map per day.

## 3. Repels and Incenses

- **Repel**: Blocks wild encounters whose levels are lower than the first Pokémon in the team. Increases the probability of Trainers to 30%.
- **Incense**: Filters the route's encounter pool to favor a specific **elemental type**.

## 4. Discovery & Pokedex Flags

The system uses two independent flags computed from the Pokédex state to determine visual representation:

1. **isSeen**: `seenPokedex.includes(id)`. Reveals name and types in tooltips.
2. **isCaught**: `pokedex.includes(id)`. Shows the actual sprite.
3. **Silhouette**: Unseen Pokémon (`isSeen = false`) show a solid black silhouette on the map to encourage exploration. In the Pokédex, they are shown as `???`.
